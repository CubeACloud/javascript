                   //While Loop

//The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

      //syntax:
      
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}

//The example below uses a do/while loop. The loop will always be executed at least once, even if the condition is false, 
//because the code block is executed before the condition is tested:

var text = ""; //variable declared.
var i = 1; //i declared before hand.

do {
  text += "<br>july date " + i; // i is the variable which show the loop value.
  i++; //increment.
}
while (i < 32);   //while loop.


//The do/while loop is a variant of the while loop. This loop will execute the code block once, 
//before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.


do {
  // code block to be executed.
}
while (condition);



example 1 for do loop:

var text = "";
var i = 1;

do {
  text += "<br>july date" + " " + i; //i is the variable which show the loop value.
  i++; //increment.
}
while (i < 32); // condition if i has to be less than 32.



//difference between while loop and for loop.


//for loop old example code:

var lang = ["java", "php", "javascript", "python"];
var i = 0;
var text = "";
for (;lang[i];) {
  text += lang[i] + "<br>";
  i++; //increment.
}
document.write(text);



//do while loop code:

var lang = ["java", "php", "javascript", "python"];
var i = 0;
var text = "";
while (lang[i]) {
  text += lang[i] + "<br>"; //[i] is the variable which show the loop value.
  i++; //increment.

}
document.write(text);
