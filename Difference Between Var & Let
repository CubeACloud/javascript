                  //DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VAR & LET

//Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope.

//Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript /program.

//Variables declared inside a functuin() can be accessed from outside the functions or conditions.

//Before ES2015 JavaScript did not have Block Scope {}.

var  y = 47;
// Here x is 47
{  
  let y = 17;
  // Here x is 17
}
// Here y is 47
document.write(y);



//let:

let j = 5;
for (let j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
  // some statements
}
document.write(j); //5



//var:

var j = 5; //global varibal
for (var j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
  // some statements
}
document.write(j); //10


//Redeclaring a JavaScript variable with var is allowed anywhere in a //program:

var y = 2;

// Now y is 2
 
var y = 3;

// Now y is 3


//Redeclaring a var variable with let, in the same scope, or in the same block, is not allowed:


var y = 22;       // Allowed
let y = 30;       // Not allowed

{
  var y = 44;   // Allowed
  let y = 50   // Not allowed
}

//Redeclaring a variable with let, in another scope, or in another block, is //allowed:

let y = 7;       // Allowed

{
  let y = 9;   // Allowed
}

{
  let y = 5;   // Allowed
}
