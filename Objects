                           //OBJECTS

//In real life, a car is an object.

//A car has properties like weight and color, and methods like start and stop.

// Create an object:

      //syntax
//object var variableName= {};
//Spaces and line breaks are not important.


//example 1

var car = {name:"civic", model:"2017", color:"grey"}; //object defined.

//it can also be written as:
//var car = {name:"civic",
 //model:"2017", 
//color:"grey"}; 

document.write("i have a " + car.name);
//output "i have a civic".



//example 2

// Create an object:
var car = {name:"civic", 
model:"2019", 
color:"grey"}; //object defined.

// Display some data from the object:
document.write("i have a " + car["name"] + " " + "model" + " "  + car["model"]);
//you can access an object property by calling property through [""].

//output "i have a civic model 2019".
