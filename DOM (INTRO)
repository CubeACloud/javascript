//JavaScript can be used to manipulate the DOM of a page dynamically to add, delete //and modify elements.

//Document Object Model

//The DOM represents a document as a tree structure.
//HTML elements become interrelated nodes in the tree.
//All those nodes in the tree have some kind of relations among each other. 
//Nodes can have child nodes. Nodes on the same tree level are called siblings.
//For example, consider the following structure:

//<html> has two children (<head>, <body>);
//<head> has one child (<title>) and one parent (<html>);
//<title> has one parent (<head>) and no children;
//<body> has two children (<h1> and <a>) and one parent (<html>);






//The innerHTML property can be used on almost all HTML elements to change its //content.
//example
document.body.innerHTML = "cubeacloud";




//example 2
//calling the function in window.onload to make sure the HTML is loaded

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
	
<head>
	
	<title>Page Title</title>
	
</head>
	
<body>
	
	<a href="http://www.blank.com">click here</a>
		
			
<script>
	
	    
		    window.onload = function() {
 
   var web = document.getElementsByTagName('a');
 
   web[0].href= 'https://cubeacloud.com';
};
	
	</script>
	
	
</body>


</html>
