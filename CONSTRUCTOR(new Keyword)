//A class is a type of function, but instead of using the keyword function to //initiate it,


//keyword class to create a class, and always add a constructor method.

class bike {
constructor(brand) {
this.bikeName = brand;

}
}

neo = new bike("power"); //The new keyword constructs and returns an //object (instance) of a constructor function.

document.write(neo.bikeName);

//The constructor method is called automatically when the object is //initialized.




//For other declarations, like functions, you will NOT get an error when you try to use it before it is declared, 
	

//code will be updated soon
